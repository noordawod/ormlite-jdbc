ORMLite JDBC
============

This package provides the JDBC specific functionality.  You will also need to download the [ormlite-core](https://github.com/j256/ormlite-core)
package as well.  Android users should download the [ormlite-android](https://github.com/j256/ormlite-android) package
instead of this JDBC one.
